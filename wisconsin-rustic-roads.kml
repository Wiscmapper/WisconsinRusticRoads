            <description>The Wisconsin Rustic Roads program was created in 1973 to provide hikers, bicyclists and motorists an opportunity to leisurely travel through the state's scenic countryside. As of 2022, there are 123 designated Rustic Roads spanning 740 miles through 61 counties. 

Did you know!?  WisDOT offers a memento for travelling 10 Rustic Roads?  Or for the truly dedicated, a lapel pin for driving all 123?  For more information, see https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/mementos.aspx

Please note: text descriptions for each Rustic Road are from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Rustic Roads program available at https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/default.aspx</description>

                <description>R-109 is referred to by some local residents as “Wisconsin’s Everglades” because the road runs through a large complex of coastal wetlands that ultimately connect to the Oconto Marsh. Along some parts of the route, travelers will see majestic cattails that line both sides of the road, as well as blue flag iris, swamp milkweed, marsh fern and lowland grasses. In the middle of the route, the trees lining the road form a graceful canopy that arches over the road. R-109 also has a century farmstead visible from the road.

                <description>This roadway takes visitors past the remnants of Medina Junction, a once bustling train depot from the early twentieth century that included a stock yard, a restaurant and store. Trains carried freight daily through the depot to destinations throughout the state and beyond.

The roadway offers views of the Rat River Wildlife Area, and is close to the southern segment of the Wiouwash State Trail as well as the Friendship State Trail, which is just south of this route.

Many types of birds and wildlife, including duck, geese, herons, cranes, beaver, muskrats, and reptiles call the marshes surrounding this roadway home.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 122</name>
                <description>Semple Road is enjoyed not only by those lucky enough to live on it, but also by bicyclists, hikers, car enthusiasts, and motorcyclists because of its flowing curves, hills and the feeling of “remoteness.” Deer, turkey and bald eagles are frequently seen along the roadway.

A bridge crosses the Missouri Creek, which lends to the road’s scenic vistas. The creek feeds into the Eau Galle River, part of the nearby Eau Galle River Wildlife Area, which offers numerous recreational opportunities.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 121</name>
                <description>This peaceful, hilly and twisty road offers an idyllic overlook on miles of farm landscapes, hills, bluffs, and ridges, left untouched by the  glaciers that once covered much of Wisconsin. Both sunrises and sunsets are spectacular, with fog and mist often gathering in the valleys below.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 120</name>
                <description>Peck Station Road, named after a Western Union Railroad stop, is agricultural in character and quite colorful in the fall. The former inn still exists as a private home. At the east side of its intersection with County A is the Troy Wildlife Area, offering many recreational opportunities, including hunting, fishing, cross country skiing and hiking.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 119</name>
                <description>R-119 is located on Washington Island. Ferry service to the island is available year-round from Northport Pier on the northern most end of the Door County Coastal Byway. The south end of the route is punctuated with sand dunes, forests and the occasional view of the rocky shoreline of Lake Michigan. The limestone bluffs along Mountain Road are part of the Niagara Escarpment. Gently rolling Town Line and Airport roads pass by forests, lavender farms and vineyards. Jackson Harbor Road just past Main Road provides access to Schoolhouse Beach, a very unique stone beach. Little Lake Road is heavily forested and provides access to People’s Park and the Jacobsen Museum.

                <description>Located in the Chequamegon - Nicolet National Forest, R-118 begins in the historic logging town of Wabeno. The Knowles Creek Impoundment and Interpretive Trail are accessible from County C. It is a popular place to view owls, hawks, eagles, loons, waterfowl and other wildlife. There is also a short interpretive trail. Indian Market Road has natural vegetation, travels through Native American lands and crosses several creeks. R-118 is a prime destination to view fall colors since it’s heavily wooded with maples, oaks, pines and poplars. The Nicolet State Trail and the Nicolet-Wolf River Scenic Byway are accessible from Wabeno.

                <description>R-117 is a tree-lined route interspersed with views of the Pine River. Wildlife abounds; travelers may see eagles, sandhill cranes, geese, turkeys, ducks and deer as well as a Class I trout stream. Several historic buildings are located along the route including the town hall, post office, historic homes and a keystone bridge. The Jefferson Davis Bell, a Civil War relic, is found there as well. R-117 also has the last of the state's original covered bridges that provides access to Covered Bridge Park, a wonderful place for visitors to walk and explore.

                <description>R-110 meanders through prime agricultural land interspersed with ponds and small lakes, marshland and rolling hills covered in trees. This route is north of the Lower Wisconsin River Road. Wildlife abounds through the route. Outstanding fall foliage make R-110 a very good tour route.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 108</name>
                <description>R-108 meanders through the Sawyer County Forest and is bordered by many species of trees including maples, oaks, birch, red and white pine which are home to many birds and mammals. Originally constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps as a logging road in the 1930s, travelers will catch a glimpse of the old “Dynamite Shack” which stored the explosives used to construct the road through the hills. R-108 is crossed by the Birkie cross country ski trail and numerous ATV, mountain bike and snowmobile trails. This road offers all nature lovers a northwoods experience.

                <description>This 13-mile loop off WIS 70 winds through the scenic Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest.

On Forest Road 148, the traveler will pass through the beautiful Smith Rapids Covered Bridge, which spans the river, and pass by the adjacent equestrian trails and picnic area. The traveler will also encounter the restored historic 1876 logging dam on Forest Road 535.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 102</name>
                <description>R-102 features roadside panoramas of native trees, prairies and dense woods that form a canopy in the spring and summer that turns golden in the autumn. This beautiful forest and field mix supports a multitude of wildlife including deer, red foxes, pheasants and sandhill cranes, short-eared owls and many songbirds. Wildflowers such as wild geraniums, Solomon’s Seal and wild asparagus are abundant and Amish buggies are a common sight. The route offers access to the Mecan River segment of the Ice Age Trail.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 94</name>
                <description>Skinner Hollow Road offers scenic views of streams, valleys and wooded areas. Rich in history, the road’s name comes from one of the area’s first recorded lead prospectors, John B. Skinner. Various prospect diggings or “badger holes” are located along the area’s valley and many Native American artifacts have also been found. As the road crosses Skinner Creek, it passes through an area that was once a mill pond for one of the area’s early sawmills. Three cheese factories once operated along the road, although only one remains as a residence. The road overlooks prairie remnants, wetlands and rock outcroppings that provide habitat for abundant wildlife from bald eagles to sandhill cranes.

                <description>R-93 is a beautiful country road that meanders through a wooded area in northwest Wisconsin in the town of Luck. A tree canopy covers the majority of this road. Chippewa Trail also curves around many ponds and wetland areas. Wildlife such as turkey and opossum abounds in this area and can be viewed by hikers, bikers and motorists. Local lore is that the Chippewa Indians used this route in pre-settlement times as they traveled between Butternut and Bone Lakes.

                <description>R-92 is a lovely, winding and hilly route that takes the traveler through a canopy of basswood, elm, maple and oak trees for part of the route—giving the traveler a feeling of entering a peaceful tunnel. During spring and summer, the sides of the road are lined with green foliage and wildflowers such as Dutchman's breeches, bloodroot, chamomile and hepatica. Rolling farm fields and steep tree-covered hills add to the beauty of the road.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 91</name>
                <description>River Drive is a scenic, unpaved loop, not far from the Wisconsin Great River Road, between WIS 54 and the Black River. It crosses over Grant Creek and passes through river bottoms alternating between wild, wooded areas and open farmland. Drive slowly; you are likely to spot stately sandhill cranes as well as wild turkey and deer.

                <description>Local residents go out of their way to travel along this quiet country road. It offers stunning vistas of rolling countryside rising to distant hills. Stalwart 300-year-old oak, basswood, hickory and maple form a shady green tunnel in spring and summer that turns russet and gold in autumn. On County G, at the eastern end of this route, is a striking contrast of yesterday and today—a weathered old barn opposite a large, modern dairy operation.

                <description>R-88 travels through a gently rolling countryside of mixed farm fields and woods. In places, large oaks arch over the road. There are several very beautiful barns built close to the road. Near the south end, you’ll see a handsome, brick Victorian farmhouse in excellent condition. Along the route you can also see St. John’s Church built in 1884, the beautifully-kept Cold Spring Cemetery dating back to the 1840s and a historical marker commemorating Abraham Lincoln’s service in the Blackhawk War.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 89</name>
                <description>This scenic road winds south from Menomonie through the bluffs of the Red Cedar River. R-89 parallels the Red Cedar State Trail; once a railroad bed, now a popular recreation trail. Halfway along the route is Devil’s Punch Bowl — a miniature canyon with a small waterfall created by the last glacier 12,000 years ago—now a 2.9 acre scientific area.

                <description>R-83 is in the town of Bear Lake and is on Narrow Gauge Road, so-called because it follows the route of an old railroad line used in the logging era. The route meanders through the 4,100-acre Barron County Forest and intersects the Ice Age Trail. Narrow Gauge Road passes through diverse terrain with native wildlife and vegetation.

                <description>R-82 is comprised of five roads: River, Spring, Rolling, Cloverland and Katzenburg. This route takes travelers through wetlands, rolling hills, old-growth wooded areas and scenic agricultural areas.

Note: To reduce backtracking, this route exits Rolling Drive at Highway 67 and heads east towards River Drive to re-join R-82.</description>

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 81</name>
                <description>R-81 is a designated bike trail. It travels most of its length along a ridge offering wonderful vistas of Wisconsin’s rolling hill country. The route is partially tree-lined with canopies of hardwood trees. Wildflowers and wildlife abound. Marty Road was constructed in the late 1800s as a farm supply conduit and five original farmhouses can be seen from the road.

                <description>Just south of the Door County Coastal Byway, R-77 parallels Lake Michigan with a Coast Guard station and lighthouse at its southern end. Many types of trees including cedar, maple, white birch and pine line the route. A municipal park is also located along R-77. It was from this spot that Native Americans “portaged” from Lake Michigan to Sturgeon Bay before the ship canal was constructed.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 76</name>
                <description>R-76 meanders through the Clark County Forest. The traveler may see deer, sandhill cranes, wild turkeys and possibly a bald eagle. There is an abandoned trestle bridge used for recreational purposes over Wedges Creek on Middle Road. At the south end of the township on Fisher Road is the “Lone Grave Marker,” the last remaining evidence of the community of Columbia, which dates back to the 1880s.

                <description>R-75 is located in the “Welsh Settlement” area, so named because immigrants from Wales settled in Iowa County during the mid 1800s. The countryside is beautiful during all seasons. Wildflowers and wildlife abound.

                <description>Located within the scenic Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, R-74 abounds with deer, songbirds and other wildlife. R-74 passes the former Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Camp Newald which operated from 1933–1942. This route crosses the Popple River, a designated Wisconsin “Wild River.” It is also near Morgan Lake Campground, a National Forest semi-wild campground.

                <description>R-71 skirts the western shore of Stone Lake where deer, raccoons, loons and other waterfowl are frequently seen. The trees along the route form a graceful arch overhead creating a tunnel of green over much of this two-mile Rustic Road.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 70</name>
                <description>R-70 meanders through the contour-stripped farms and the tree-covered hills of the Platte River Valley. Liberty Ridge Road passes a church built in 1861 by German settlers, then ambles into the quaint community of Stitzer. The other branches of R-70 pass through the rambling countryside. One of the few remaining one-room schoolhouses in the area is located on Scenic Road.

Note: I experienced a lot of issues with roads properly snapping to the desired route in GaiaGPS while editing.  So be smart when following this route!

                <description>R-69 travels along the historic Portage Canal. On one side of the road, wetland habitat harbors sandhill cranes, great blue herons and many other birds. This road leads to the historic Indian Agency House, built in 1832. This federal-style house is on its original site and is one of the oldest in Wisconsin. It is also on the National Register of Historic Places and is open to the public.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 66</name>
                <description>Beautiful scenery and history distinguish this Rustic Road. R-66 travels the unglaciated “Driftless Area” of southwestern Wisconsin. Tree-lined roads wind through the hilly fields and farmlands. In autumn, R-66 displays spectacular fall colors. An abandoned lead mine, complete with tin shacks, rusted ore buckets and piles of tailings, is visible from Kennedy Road. The mining industry in this part of Wisconsin once produced 85% of the nation’s lead.

Note: in order to reduce backtracking, I designed this route to exit R-66 off Kennedy Road on to County W.  It then heads west towards Hazel Green, south on State Highway 80, the re-joins R-66 at Buncombe Road.

                <description>Located near the Van Loon Wildlife Area, this route offers a rather unique combination of historic transportation, architecture and scenic views. From Amsterdam Prairie Road, it is possible to enter by foot to historic McGilvray Road, also known as 7-Bridges Road. McGilvray Road is on the National Register of Historic Places because of its seven rare bowstring-arch bridges. Travel one mile south to link to the Wisconsin Great River Road, one of Wisconsin's Scenic Byways.

                <description>Hawthorne Road is the only gravel road in the city of Mequon. Much of the road is lined with oak, maple and weeping willow trees that provide a canopy in the summer and a blaze of color in the fall. The open land along R-65 is under cultivation or is pasture land for horses and sheep making pleasant agricultural vistas. The area surrounding the road is habitat for deer, rabbits, hawks and songbirds. The road is popular with hikers, bikers, equestrians and motorists.

                <description>County S rests on the remains of glacial sand and stone. The glacial soil here is so poor, you’ll notice several old farm fields being reclaimed by trees and shrubs. The last portion of R-63 is old forest with steep Kettle Moraine hills and curves. The Rustic Road route ends at the village limits of historic Glenbeulah. The Wade House state historic site and the Wesley Jung Carriage Museum are both must-see attractions.

                <description>In the spring, Tunnelville Road is characterized by fields of trillium. In summer, ferns and wildflowers line the steep road edges. The fall foliage is always colorful, and in winter the traveler will appreciate the views of the hillsides covered with snow.

                <description>This wooded, rural road is located in one of the highest points in Washington County and offers a scenic panorama of the surrounding countryside. There are several historical buildings and farmsteads including a log home and an old fieldstone house dating to the late 1800s. While on Blue Goose and St. Augustine Roads in Ozaukee County, travelers will go past portions of the Cedarburg Bog State Natural Area - one of the largest and most biologically diverse wetland areas in Wisconsin.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 51</name>
                <description>Just east of the Wisconsin Great River Road, located near rolling agricultural farmland, this narrow, winding, gravel road frequently crosses a trout stream in the midst of dense woodlands. At the intersection of 50th Avenue and County CC, there is a lovely old church from the late 1800s. Just a few miles south of County CC is a wayside historical marker and a replica of the house where Laura Ingalls Wilder grew up. She wrote about this house in the book Little House in the Big Woods.

                <description>The locals call Cottonville Avenue “Old State Road” because it was laid out by the state, probably in the 1800s. Vistas along this road include native lowland and upland trees, shrubbery and marshes. Wild birds, deer and grouse abound.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 48</name>
                <description>This road curves among rolling hills, typical of the ground moraines found in Wisconsin’s central plains region. R-48 passes through the valley of the Pine River, a Class I trout stream. Much of the agricultural land and fallow fields found along this route support ring-necked pheasants, sandhill cranes, deer, red fox, beaver, otter and a wide variety of song birds. A log cabin and two farmhouses, built before the Civil War on 160-acre Homestead Act grants, are visible from R-48.

                <description>Featuring open agricultural vistas against a backdrop of wooded hills, R-47 is a traveler’s delight. Historic buildings along the route include a round barn and a red granite town hall. The road crosses two streams and passes conifer glens, wetland vegetation and rolling fields. County M also passes the Tigerton Historical Society Museum and the Wittenberg Historical Museum.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 33</name>
                <description>This winding, hilly route passes through a natural kettle area. While the area is mainly devoted to agriculture, R-33 offers travelers a view of the church spires atop Holy Hill, a well-known seminary in southeastern Wisconsin. Another section of the road offers a view of Lowe Lake.

Note: this route turns north on County Highway K after leaving Emerald Drive, and re-joins R33 at Shamrock Lane.  This seems to be the most efficient way to travel the entire route.

                <description>Although this Rustic Road is short in distance, it is long in aesthetic quality. R-62 offers the only access to Timms Hill County Park, the highest point in the state of Wisconsin at 1,951.5 feet. Hikers will enjoy the Timms Hill National Trail and nearby Ice Age Trail. Bass Lake, which borders R-62, teems with Northern Pike.

                <description>Many wooded areas, wetlands and agricultural uses are adjacent to the road’s 3.3-mile course. R-61 crosses several streams and stretches along several wetland areas that are part of the Wolf River watershed. Several large white pines can be spotted along this road, often in combination with large stands of trees.

                <description>This winding route travels through the Northern Highland/American Legion State Forest. Canopies of coniferous and hardwood trees enhance the scenic beauty of R-60 as it passes near old logging camp sites, hiking trails and an old saw mill located in Star Lake. The entire stretch of this scenic drive traverses heavily wooded areas abundant with wildlife. R-60 offers frequent scenic vistas of numerous, clear Northwoods lakes and dense forestland.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 59</name>
                <description>R-59 can be characterized as a lightly traveled Northwoods wilderness road. Along this route you will see log cabins used by some of the original homesteaders in the Minocqua area. Sutton Road, whose narrow roadbed is a mixture of gravel and sand, travels through hardwood and pine forest offering frequent glimpses of native wildlife.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 58</name>
                <description>Blue Lake Road skirts many scenic Northwoods’ lakes while wandering through thick pine and hardwood forests. This route crosses a railroad bed that was used in the 1800s as a main line to Minocqua. It has been converted to the Bearskin State Trail for hiking and bicycling. Where Blue Lake Road intersects the Tomahawk River, you’ll find an ideal spot for launching a canoe. The Northwoods beauty continues along Mercer Lake Road as it travels across two small creeks, through cedar lowlands and dense pine and hardwood forests before intersecting with WIS 70.

                <description>The Ice Age National Scenic Trail follows this route. A log house used by hikers is located on the Foley Road segment. The scenic beauty of R-57 is enhanced by rolling hills and an arch of trees over the road at two points. Deep ravines directly off the road are accented with ferns and a variety of wild flowers. Bluebirds and other wild song birds are regular visitors to the large apple orchard along both sides of South Foley Road. The Waupaca River flows along a portion of the road; the rapids can be heard at the Cobbtown Road bridge.

                <description>A canopy of large oak and black walnut trees grace Wheatland Road, just south of WIS 142. Travelers to this area will enjoy the open agricultural and marsh vistas as well as an old brick farmhouse and several barns. Hoosier Creek Road is a half-mile away from the Fox River, providing fishing areas and panoramic views.

NOTE: FOR SAFETY REASONS, HOOSIER CREEK ROAD (NEAR COUNTY JB) IS CLOSED AT THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND IS NO LONGER A CONTINUOUS NORTH-SOUTH ROUTE.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 38</name>
                <description>Paved between Moonlight Bay and North Bay, R-38 passes through a unique boreal forest filled with magnificent specimens of spruce, cedar and white pine as well as various species of rare and valuable plants. This Rustic Road, near the Door County Coastal Byway, provides scenic views of the Lake Michigan shoreline as well as access to Cana Island Lighthouse, which has guided sailors since 1870.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 31</name>
                <description>R-31 travelers can view a pair of historic homes: the Palmer-Gullickson Octagon House, on the National Register of Historic Places, and the Hamlin Garland Homestead, where the late Pulitzer prize-winning author, who was born near West Salem, did much of his writing. Other points of interest include the former home of Thomas Leonard, founder of West Salem, and Swarthout Lakeside Park, a recreation area near Lake Neshonoc.

Important Note: I have some doubts about this route when it swings north off County B.  Does it turn north on North Mill Street, or North on South Leonard Street?  WisDOT GIS data does not match simplified map on R-31 webpage.

                <description>Ruff Road, Orchard Drive and Slotty Road are narrow, gravel roads. They wind through rolling, rugged terrain near Natural Bridge State Park. The park is the location of the Raddatz Rock Shelter, the oldest documented site of primitive man in the upper Midwest. Schara Road extends along a ridge bordered by oak, maple, basswood and hickory trees. Remains of an old barn and home foundation are visible from the road. A walk during the spring and summer reveals many wildflowers along the roadside and in the open fields.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 05</name>
                <description>Loomis Road was originally laid out as a territorial road in 1840 and retains much of its original rustic lines. This route passes Colonel Heg Memorial Park, which commemorates Wisconsin’s top-ranking officer killed in action during the Civil War. A museum in the park honors the heritage of the area’s Norwegian settlers and their contribution to Wisconsin’s development. There is also a small log cabin, built in 1837, then moved to the park in 1928.

                <description>This narrow road borders the heavily wooded Glen Hills County Park area, as well as privately owned farmland. The blacktop road curves over many hills with open views of farmland to either side. Picnic at the nearby county park, or enjoy the beach on Glen Lake. A bike trail is posted along the route.

                <description>Located along the Lake Michigan shore, just east of the Door County Coastal Byway, this route passes through sand dunes, heavy forest and streams that are natural spawning grounds for trout and smelt. Other sites include an old sawmill, fishing site, log cabin and a panoramic view of Lake Michigan with a beautiful sand beach.

                <description>This curving trail rides the narrow isthmus between Upper and Lower Nashotah Lakes, then runs south past Upper Nemahbin Lake. The broad fields of Pabst Farms and the remainder of its once-famous dairy barns lie to the west. To the north of Mill Road, the red-tiled spires and gables of Nashotah House Seminary can be seen.

                <description>At various points the road offers panoramic views of lush green hills and valleys. The sharply curving route passes outstanding Kettle Moraine formations, pine and spruce plantations, a tamarack swamp and several ponds. R-12 crosses the White River and runs through the community of Lyons with its several quaint churches.

                <description>Bordered on either side by native prairie plants, including numerous stands of wild plum and scattered wild asparagus, R-19 crosses Swan and Murphy Creeks and borders the Waubesa Wetlands State Natural Area. Set back in the evergreens along one side of the road is the William Lalor Farm, originally purchased from the government in 1846. The original deed was signed by President James Polk.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 20</name>
                <description>Rich in heritage, Dyreson Road travels through fertile farmland and wooded areas. The road offers an excellent view of Lake Kegonsa as it crosses County B. Historic Dyreson Bridge over the Yahara River is the site of early Indian and pioneer crossings and is adjacent to ancient Indian effigy mound sites. Nearby wetlands provide glimpses of native waterfowl, fish and wildlife. Also located on the road is Dyreson House, an early Wisconsin homestead listed in the Wisconsin State Historical Society’s Inventory of Historic Places.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 16</name>
                <description>This gently winding route runs through Point Beach State Forest. R-16 is bordered on either side by thick groves of deciduous and coniferous trees. Sandy Bay Road offers many glimpses of birds and other wildlife, as well as open vistas of natural sand dunes, including juniper bushes and other types of shrubbery.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 01</name>
                <description>Wisconsin’s first Rustic Road was dedicated in 1975. A historical marker alongside the road commemorates the designation. R-1 crosses through hills and valleys created by the last Wisconsin glacier nearly 12,000 years ago. A public beach is located at South Harper Lake. Timm's Hill National Trail, just north of the Ice Age Trail, runs between R-1 and R-62, located nine miles north in Timm's Hill County Park. The park is open year round for hiking, skiing and showshoeing.

                <description>R-4 runs south parallel to R-3 and borders the east side of the Glen Hills County Park watershed area. Beautiful fall colors mark the road in autumn, along with many coniferous trees. Watch for glacial rock formations and wild turkeys.
