            <description>The Wisconsin Rustic Roads program was created in 1973 to provide hikers, bicyclists and motorists an opportunity to leisurely travel through the state's scenic countryside. As of 2022, there are 123 designated Rustic Roads spanning 740 miles through 61 counties. 

Did you know!?  WisDOT offers a memento for travelling 10 Rustic Roads?  Or for the truly dedicated, a lapel pin for driving all 123?  For more information, see https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/mementos.aspx

Please note: text descriptions for each Rustic Road are from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Rustic Roads program available at https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/default.aspx</description>

                <description>In the spring, Tunnelville Road is characterized by fields of trillium. In summer, ferns and wildflowers line the steep road edges. The fall foliage is always colorful, and in winter the traveler will appreciate the views of the hillsides covered with snow.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 52</name>
                <description>This wooded, rural road is located in one of the highest points in Washington County and offers a scenic panorama of the surrounding countryside. There are several historical buildings and farmsteads including a log home and an old fieldstone house dating to the late 1800s. While on Blue Goose and St. Augustine Roads in Ozaukee County, travelers will go past portions of the Cedarburg Bog State Natural Area - one of the largest and most biologically diverse wetland areas in Wisconsin.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 51</name>
                <description>Just east of the Wisconsin Great River Road, located near rolling agricultural farmland, this narrow, winding, gravel road frequently crosses a trout stream in the midst of dense woodlands. At the intersection of 50th Avenue and County CC, there is a lovely old church from the late 1800s. Just a few miles south of County CC is a wayside historical marker and a replica of the house where Laura Ingalls Wilder grew up. She wrote about this house in the book Little House in the Big Woods.

                <description>The locals call Cottonville Avenue “Old State Road” because it was laid out by the state, probably in the 1800s. Vistas along this road include native lowland and upland trees, shrubbery and marshes. Wild birds, deer and grouse abound.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 48</name>
                <description>This road curves among rolling hills, typical of the ground moraines found in Wisconsin’s central plains region. R-48 passes through the valley of the Pine River, a Class I trout stream. Much of the agricultural land and fallow fields found along this route support ring-necked pheasants, sandhill cranes, deer, red fox, beaver, otter and a wide variety of song birds. A log cabin and two farmhouses, built before the Civil War on 160-acre Homestead Act grants, are visible from R-48.

                <description>Featuring open agricultural vistas against a backdrop of wooded hills, R-47 is a traveler’s delight. Historic buildings along the route include a round barn and a red granite town hall. The road crosses two streams and passes conifer glens, wetland vegetation and rolling fields. County M also passes the Tigerton Historical Society Museum and the Wittenberg Historical Museum.

                <description>Although this Rustic Road is short in distance, it is long in aesthetic quality. R-62 offers the only access to Timms Hill County Park, the highest point in the state of Wisconsin at 1,951.5 feet. Hikers will enjoy the Timms Hill National Trail and nearby Ice Age Trail. Bass Lake, which borders R-62, teems with Northern Pike.

                <description>Many wooded areas, wetlands and agricultural uses are adjacent to the road’s 3.3-mile course. R-61 crosses several streams and stretches along several wetland areas that are part of the Wolf River watershed. Several large white pines can be spotted along this road, often in combination with large stands of trees.

                <description>This winding route travels through the Northern Highland/American Legion State Forest. Canopies of coniferous and hardwood trees enhance the scenic beauty of R-60 as it passes near old logging camp sites, hiking trails and an old saw mill located in Star Lake. The entire stretch of this scenic drive traverses heavily wooded areas abundant with wildlife. R-60 offers frequent scenic vistas of numerous, clear Northwoods lakes and dense forestland.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 59</name>
                <description>R-59 can be characterized as a lightly traveled Northwoods wilderness road. Along this route you will see log cabins used by some of the original homesteaders in the Minocqua area. Sutton Road, whose narrow roadbed is a mixture of gravel and sand, travels through hardwood and pine forest offering frequent glimpses of native wildlife.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 58</name>
                <description>Blue Lake Road skirts many scenic Northwoods’ lakes while wandering through thick pine and hardwood forests. This route crosses a railroad bed that was used in the 1800s as a main line to Minocqua. It has been converted to the Bearskin State Trail for hiking and bicycling. Where Blue Lake Road intersects the Tomahawk River, you’ll find an ideal spot for launching a canoe. The Northwoods beauty continues along Mercer Lake Road as it travels across two small creeks, through cedar lowlands and dense pine and hardwood forests before intersecting with WIS 70.

                <description>The Ice Age National Scenic Trail follows this route. A log house used by hikers is located on the Foley Road segment. The scenic beauty of R-57 is enhanced by rolling hills and an arch of trees over the road at two points. Deep ravines directly off the road are accented with ferns and a variety of wild flowers. Bluebirds and other wild song birds are regular visitors to the large apple orchard along both sides of South Foley Road. The Waupaca River flows along a portion of the road; the rapids can be heard at the Cobbtown Road bridge.

                <description>A canopy of large oak and black walnut trees grace Wheatland Road, just south of WIS 142. Travelers to this area will enjoy the open agricultural and marsh vistas as well as an old brick farmhouse and several barns. Hoosier Creek Road is a half-mile away from the Fox River, providing fishing areas and panoramic views.

NOTE: FOR SAFETY REASONS, HOOSIER CREEK ROAD (NEAR COUNTY JB) IS CLOSED AT THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND IS NO LONGER A CONTINUOUS NORTH-SOUTH ROUTE.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 38</name>
                <description>Paved between Moonlight Bay and North Bay, R-38 passes through a unique boreal forest filled with magnificent specimens of spruce, cedar and white pine as well as various species of rare and valuable plants. This Rustic Road, near the Door County Coastal Byway, provides scenic views of the Lake Michigan shoreline as well as access to Cana Island Lighthouse, which has guided sailors since 1870.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 33</name>
                <description>This winding, hilly route passes through a natural kettle area. While the area is mainly devoted to agriculture, R-33 offers travelers a view of the church spires atop Holy Hill, a well-known seminary in southeastern Wisconsin. Another section of the road offers a view of Lowe Lake.

Note: this route turns north on County Highway K after leaving Emerald Drive, and re-joins R33 at Shamrock Lane.  This seems to be the most efficient way to travel the entire route.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 31</name>
                <description>R-31 travelers can view a pair of historic homes: the Palmer-Gullickson Octagon House, on the National Register of Historic Places, and the Hamlin Garland Homestead, where the late Pulitzer prize-winning author, who was born near West Salem, did much of his writing. Other points of interest include the former home of Thomas Leonard, founder of West Salem, and Swarthout Lakeside Park, a recreation area near Lake Neshonoc.

Important Note: I have some doubts about this route when it swings north off County B.  Does it turn north on North Mill Street, or North on South Leonard Street?  WisDOT GIS data does not match simplified map on R-31 webpage.

                <description>Ruff Road, Orchard Drive and Slotty Road are narrow, gravel roads. They wind through rolling, rugged terrain near Natural Bridge State Park. The park is the location of the Raddatz Rock Shelter, the oldest documented site of primitive man in the upper Midwest. Schara Road extends along a ridge bordered by oak, maple, basswood and hickory trees. Remains of an old barn and home foundation are visible from the road. A walk during the spring and summer reveals many wildflowers along the roadside and in the open fields.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 05</name>
                <description>Loomis Road was originally laid out as a territorial road in 1840 and retains much of its original rustic lines. This route passes Colonel Heg Memorial Park, which commemorates Wisconsin’s top-ranking officer killed in action during the Civil War. A museum in the park honors the heritage of the area’s Norwegian settlers and their contribution to Wisconsin’s development. There is also a small log cabin, built in 1837, then moved to the park in 1928.

                <description>This narrow road borders the heavily wooded Glen Hills County Park area, as well as privately owned farmland. The blacktop road curves over many hills with open views of farmland to either side. Picnic at the nearby county park, or enjoy the beach on Glen Lake. A bike trail is posted along the route.

                <description>Located along the Lake Michigan shore, just east of the Door County Coastal Byway, this route passes through sand dunes, heavy forest and streams that are natural spawning grounds for trout and smelt. Other sites include an old sawmill, fishing site, log cabin and a panoramic view of Lake Michigan with a beautiful sand beach.

                <description>This curving trail rides the narrow isthmus between Upper and Lower Nashotah Lakes, then runs south past Upper Nemahbin Lake. The broad fields of Pabst Farms and the remainder of its once-famous dairy barns lie to the west. To the north of Mill Road, the red-tiled spires and gables of Nashotah House Seminary can be seen.

                <description>At various points the road offers panoramic views of lush green hills and valleys. The sharply curving route passes outstanding Kettle Moraine formations, pine and spruce plantations, a tamarack swamp and several ponds. R-12 crosses the White River and runs through the community of Lyons with its several quaint churches.

                <description>Bordered on either side by native prairie plants, including numerous stands of wild plum and scattered wild asparagus, R-19 crosses Swan and Murphy Creeks and borders the Waubesa Wetlands State Natural Area. Set back in the evergreens along one side of the road is the William Lalor Farm, originally purchased from the government in 1846. The original deed was signed by President James Polk.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 20</name>
                <description>Rich in heritage, Dyreson Road travels through fertile farmland and wooded areas. The road offers an excellent view of Lake Kegonsa as it crosses County B. Historic Dyreson Bridge over the Yahara River is the site of early Indian and pioneer crossings and is adjacent to ancient Indian effigy mound sites. Nearby wetlands provide glimpses of native waterfowl, fish and wildlife. Also located on the road is Dyreson House, an early Wisconsin homestead listed in the Wisconsin State Historical Society’s Inventory of Historic Places.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 16</name>
                <description>This gently winding route runs through Point Beach State Forest. R-16 is bordered on either side by thick groves of deciduous and coniferous trees. Sandy Bay Road offers many glimpses of birds and other wildlife, as well as open vistas of natural sand dunes, including juniper bushes and other types of shrubbery.

                <name>Wisconsin Rustic Road 01</name>
                <description>Wisconsin’s first Rustic Road was dedicated in 1975. A historical marker alongside the road commemorates the designation. R-1 crosses through hills and valleys created by the last Wisconsin glacier nearly 12,000 years ago. A public beach is located at South Harper Lake. Timm's Hill National Trail, just north of the Ice Age Trail, runs between R-1 and R-62, located nine miles north in Timm's Hill County Park. The park is open year round for hiking, skiing and showshoeing.

                <description>R-4 runs south parallel to R-3 and borders the east side of the Glen Hills County Park watershed area. Beautiful fall colors mark the road in autumn, along with many coniferous trees. Watch for glacial rock formations and wild turkeys.
